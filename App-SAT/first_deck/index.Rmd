## U.S. High School Education could be better

Can we learn from SAT scores?
More generally, can we educate voters on complex, data-driven issues?

1. The United States lags behind other industrialized nations in secondary education.
2. Differences in large population means of educational attainment must have underlying causes.
3. Local solutions, such as charter schools, don't address the fundamental problem
    + Success is often just a matter of exclusivity
    + No local system has found an answer scalable to a state or a country
    + Any conjectured local solution would be expensive to scale

## Data Exists that Could Shed Light on Answers

1. Individual states have widely differing approaches to education
2. A common, though imperfect, standardized measure exists... the SAT

### Can We Learn from SAT Scores? or...
### Has one of our United States solved the high school education problem? 
```{r SATtable, echo=FALSE}
library(UsingR)
data(SAT)
head(SAT, 5)
print(c("Maximum State SAT score", max(SAT$total)))
print(c("Minimum State SAT score", min(SAT$total)))
```

## Simple Analysis Produces Erroneous Conclusions

1. SAT scores do not appear correlated to expected inputs
    + Insensitive to teacher salary, class size and spending per pupil
    + Relativley "poor" states appear to have better outcomes
2. Cursory analysis shows that North Dakota appears to be successful
    + A closer look shows that self-selection bias might be at the root of high SAT scores
    + The only measure with strong correlation is percentage of students taking the test
3. We believe that interactive data will better educate voters
    + Issues are complex but web-based tools can make them intuitive
    + Future product enhancements are coming soon
    
## App-SAT is just the beginning...
